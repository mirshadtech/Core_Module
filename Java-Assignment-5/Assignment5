ðŸ’¡Q1.What is Exception in Java?

In Java, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. It is a mechanism provided by 
the Java programming language to handle runtime errors, abnormal conditions, and exceptional situations that may occur during program execution.

ðŸ’¡Q2.What is Exception Handling?

Exception handling in Java is a mechanism provided by the language to handle exceptions that occur during the execution of a program. It allows developers 
to catch, handle, and recover from exceptions gracefully, rather than abruptly terminating the program.

ðŸ’¡Q3.What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions and Error?

The main difference between checked and unchecked exceptions lies in how they are handled. Checked exceptions must be caught or declared, either by 
handling 
them with a try-catch block or declaring them in the method signature. Unchecked exceptions, on the other hand, are not required to be caught or declared 
explicitly.
Errors, unlike exceptions, are not meant to be caught or handled by the application code. They indicate severe problems that often result in abnormal 
termination of the program.

ðŸ’¡Q4.What are the difference between throw and throws in Java?

In Java, both throw and throws are used in the context of exception handling, but they serve different purposes. Throw is used to manually throw an 
exception, while throws is used in a method declaration to indicate that the method may throw one or more exceptions, allowing the calling code to handle 
them.

ðŸ’¡Q5.What is multithreading in Java? mention its advantages

Multithreading in Java refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program.
Advantages of multithreading in Java include:
1. Increased responsiveness and performance
2. Better resource utilization: 
3. Responsiveness to user interaction: 
4. Concurrent execution of independent tasks:
5. Effective utilization of multiprocessor systems:

ðŸ’¡Q6.Write a program to create and call a custom exception

// Custom exception class
class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

class CustomExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new CustomException("Custom exception occurred!");
        } 
        } catch (CustomException e) {
            System.out.println("Custom exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

ðŸ’¡Q7.How can you handle exceptions in Java? 

In Java, exceptions can be handled using the try-catch block and the `throws` clause.
1. Try-Catch Block:
   The try-catch block is used to handle exceptions that may occur within a specific block of code. The structure of a try-catch block is as follows:
   try {
       // Code that may throw an exception
   } catch (ExceptionType exception) {
       // Exception handling code for ExceptionType
   } finally {
       // Optional: Code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
   }

2. Throws Clause:
   The `throws` clause is used in a method declaration to indicate that the method may throw one or more exceptions. The structure of the `throws` clause 
   is as follows:
   returnType methodName(parameters) throws ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2 {
       // Method body that may throw exceptions
   }

ðŸ’¡Q8.What is Thread in Java?

In Java, a thread is a lightweight unit of execution that represents a separate flow of control within a program. It allows concurrent execution of 
multiple tasks within a single program.

ðŸ’¡Q9. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java?

In Java, there are two ways to implement threads:

1. Extending the Thread Class:
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           // Code to be executed in the thread
       }
   }

   MyThread thread = new MyThread();
   thread.start();
  
2. Implementing the Runnable Interface:
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           // Code to be executed in the thread
       }
   }

   Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
   thread.start();

ðŸ’¡Q10.What do you mean by garbage collection?

Garbage collection is an automatic memory management feature in programming languages like Java. It is the process of automatically reclaiming memory 
occupied by objects that are no longer needed or referenced by the program. The garbage collector identifies and frees up memory that is no longer in use, 
allowing it to be reallocated for other purposes.
